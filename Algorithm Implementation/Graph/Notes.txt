**Theorem: Raising an adjacency matrix A of simple graph G to the n-th power gives the 
number of n-length walks between two vertices vi, vj of G in the resulting matrix.
  
**Two trees of heights a and b are p meters apart. The height of the point of intersection of the lines 
joining the top of each tree to the foot of the opposite tree is given by (a*b)/(a+b).

**Euler's formula for planar Graphs:
If G is a planar graph having v vertices, e edges and f faces (regions divided in the plane by the graph),
then: v - e + f = 2
so f = e - v + 2.

**Transpose graph (the same graph with the direction of every edge reversed) has exactly the same strongly connected components as the original graph
