**Amount of prime numbers non greater than n is about n/log(n).
Amount of palindrome numbers with fixed length k â€” it is about 10^((k+1)/2).
Therefore the number of primes asymptotically bigger than the number of palindromic numbers.

**For every Pythagorean triplet a > 3 and a + b + c is even

**F(n)=4*F(n-3)+F(n-6)  where, F(n) = nth fibonacci number

**All primes greater than 3 can be written in the form 6k+1 or 6k-1.
**Any number n can have only one primefactor greater than sqrt(n)
