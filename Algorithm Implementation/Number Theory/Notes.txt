**Amount of prime numbers non greater than n is about n/log(n).
Amount of palindrome numbers with fixed length k — it is about 10^((k+1)/2).
Therefore the number of primes asymptotically bigger than the number of palindromic numbers.

**F(n)=4*F(n-3)+F(n-6)  where, F(n) = nth fibonacci number

**All primes greater than 3 can be written in the form 6k+1 or 6k-1.
**Any number n can have only one primefactor greater than sqrt(n)

**For every Pythagorean triplet a > 3 and a + b + c is even

**A Pythagorean triplet (a, b, c) is by definition primitive if a, b, c are pairwise co-prime
**All primitive Pythagorean triplets can be represented as a = (m^2) − (n^2), b = 2*m*n, c = (m^2) + (n^2)
with m > n > 0, perhaps exchanging a and b to have a < b. These formulae
always produce a Pythagorean triplet, but it will be primitive if and only if
exactly one of m, n is even and other is odd and gcd(m, n) = 1
**From any Pythagorean triplet you get a primitive one by dividing out the greatest
common divisor, so every Pythagorean triplet has a unique representation a = ((m^2) − (n^2))*d, b = 2*m*n*d, c = ((m^2) + (n^2))*d
with m > n > 0, gcd(m, n) = 1 and exactly one of m, n even and d is the gcd of a, b and c

**D(t) = D(n/2)(D(n+1) if n is even 
or D(t) = D(n)(D((n+1)/2) if (n+1) is even
D(t) = number of divisors of a triangular number
