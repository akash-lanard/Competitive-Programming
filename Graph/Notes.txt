Theorem: Raising an adjacency matrix A of simple graph G to the n-th power gives the 
number of n-length walks between two vertices vi, vj of G in the resulting matrix.
  
Two trees of heights a and b are p meters apart. The height of the point of intersection of the lines 
joining the top of each tree to the foot of the opposite tree is given by (a*b)/(a+b).
